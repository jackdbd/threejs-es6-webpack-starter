## Usage (production)

Generate all js/css bundles

yarn build
```

## Other

Analyze webpack bundles offline:

```shell
yarn build  # to generate build/stats.json
yarn stats  # uses webpack-bundle-analyzer as CLI
```

or push to a CI (e.g. [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/)), let it build your project and analyze your bundles online at [packtracker.io](https://packtracker.io/).

Check outdated dependencies with [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/tjunnone/npm-check-updates):

```shell
yarn ncu
```

Update all outdated dependencies at once:

```shell
yarn ncuu
```

Or let [updtr](https://github.com/peerigon/updtr) update all your dependencies for you:

```shell
yarn updtr
```

## Credits

The setup of this starter project was inspired by two snippets on Codepen: [this one](http://codepen.io/mo4_9/pen/VjqRQX) and [this one](https://codepen.io/iamphill/pen/jPYorE).

I understood how to work with lights and camera helpers thanks to
[this snippet](http://jsfiddle.net/f17Lz5ux/5131/) on JSFiddle.

The code for `vertexShader.glsl` and `fragmentShader.glsl` is taken from
[this blog post](http://blog.cjgammon.com/threejs-custom-shader-material).
